<details>
<summary><b>pyinstaller</b></summary>

-   What it does: Compiles the Python server into a single `.exe` and a console/website system. This is the simplest build.
-   requirements:
    -   [atleast python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   How to build:
    1.  Open a cmd in the `builders` folder.
    2.  Run `.\pyinstaller.cmd`.

<details>
<summary><b>electron</b></summary>

-   requirements:
    -   [atleast python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    -   [node.js (LTS)](https://nodejs.org/)
-   How to build:

<details>
<summary><b>nuitka</b></summary>

-   What it does: Also compiles the source code into a console/website application. Nuitka can be very resource-heavy when compiling.
-   requirements:
    -   [atleast python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    -   A 6+ core CPU is recommended (compilation time takes 20~ minutes on an 8-core Ryzen 7).
-   How to build:
    1.  Open a cmd in the `builders` folder.
    2.  Run `.\nuitka.cmd`.
-   benefits
    1. nuitka often will out perform pyinstaller
    2. nuitka will output smaller final executable size (but requires more open space to compile which is around 2gb)
